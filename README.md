# Overview

Add this stage to any character to allow yourself to hypnotize them!

## How to use

To hypnotize a character, add `*snap*` to your message. Try
to phrase the command as a new belief of the character.

_Example: \*snap\* "You now believe the sky is green."_

## Overpowering mode

In overpowering mode, the hypnotic effect is stronger and cannot be
resisted by the character. You can change it on the settings panel.
